# School-Announcement-Website
School website that allows teachers to post announcements for students to view based on grade, club and gender. This was made for school computer science final project. Made using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS

## Get Started
-Download "website" folder
-Run "homepage.html" on your browser of choice 

## Coding Manual
This is just a documentation of how the site was created and all aspects of the code. Both HTML and JS are included in this explanation.

## Additional Notes
The teacher side has a login page. The username can be the current name of the user and will show up on the post when created. 

The PASSWORD is: "northP123" (case sensitive)
*NOTE, since this was for a school project, the password isn't encrypted and is saved on the client side
 meaning anyone with basic coding knowledge can find it out.
 
 I plan on fixing this in the future to add more security to the site.
